<h2> Assignment 1: Auto Correct </h2>

<h2> Assignment 2: Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS) </h2>
Welcome to the second assignment of Course 2 in the Natural Language Processing specialization. This assignment will develop skills in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an input text. Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are Ambiguous. Let's look at the following example:

The whole team played well. [adverb]
You are doing well for yourself. [adjective]
Well, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]
The well is dry. [noun]
Tears were beginning to well in her eyes. [verb]
Distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence will help you better understand the meaning of a sentence. This would be critically important in search queries. Identifying the proper noun, the organization, the stock symbol, or anything similar would greatly improve everything ranging from speech recognition to search. By completing this assignment, you will:

Learn how parts-of-speech tagging works
Compute the transition matrix A in a Hidden Markov Model
Compute the emission matrix B in a Hidden Markov Model
Compute the Viterbi algorithm
Compute the accuracy of your own model

<h2> Assignment 3: Language Models: Auto-Complete</h2>
In this assignment, you will build an auto-complete system. Auto-complete system is something you may see every day

When you google something, you often have suggestions to help you complete your search.
When you are writing an email, you get suggestions telling you possible endings to your sentence.
By the end of this assignment, you will develop a prototype of such a system.
